### PROJECTS
#### **GitEDU** — *Online IDE Service*
Service with the purpose of allowing universities to be able to offer students a low cost, open source Linux based extensible IDE online. This is my engineering thesis along with some other services that add functionality as listed below. Currently Python 3, Shell Script and PostgreSQL are supported languages for execution in the Kubernetes/Docker backend (see EduNube project). Classic Username/Password in addition to LTI authentication (for direct integration with most LMS like Moodle, OpenEdX, etc) is supported. Front end uses Cloud9’s open source ACE editor and Twitter Bootstrap. Written in Python with the Django Framework. Code at: [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/nishedcob/GitEDU) (see GitEDU directory and gitedu branch, activate-ge.sh for VirtualEnv creation/pip install and activation)

#### **EduNube** — *Code Execution Service*
Service for receiving HTTP requests and executing the code in a secure virtualized environment (currently a Virtualized Kubernetes Cluster with Docker)  as part of the functionality offered in GitEDU service in my engineering thesis. JSON Web Tokens are used for API authentication. Written in Python with the Django Framework with a Shell Script Backend. Code at: [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/nishedcob/GitEDU) (see EduNube, Docker and Kubernetes directories and edunube branch, activate-en.sh for VirtualEnv creation/pip install and activation)

#### **GitServerHTTPEndpoint** — *Convert HTTP requests into Git Objects, for use with GitWeb*
Service for receiving HTTP requests and converting them into their respective objects in locally hosted Git repositories as part of the functionality offered in GitEDU service in my engineering thesis. JSON Web Tokens are used for API authentication. Written in Python with the Django Framework with a Shell Script Backend. Code at: [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/nishedcob/GitServerHTTPEndpoint) (VirtualEnv/Dependency Management with PipEnv)

#### **postgresql-code-executor-template** — *Execute Shell Script and PostgreSQL statements in a Docker Container*
Template for executing shell script and PostgreSQL statements within a Docker container using EduNube service as part of the functionality of my engineering thesis.
